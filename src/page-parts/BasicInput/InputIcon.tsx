            Using Icons is a great way to make a normal Input stand out as well
            as give some context to what content goes in there. It's also common
            now to see small action buttons at the end of inputs to toggle a
            quick function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Both of these are small touches that can improve the UX of a common
            form.
